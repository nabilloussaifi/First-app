# My first application - Development First round
- Repository: `<Name-of-your-app>`
- Type of Challenge: `learning challenge`
- Duration: `3.5 days`

## Learning Objectives

##### Setup, design and manage a database management system
* Think ahead of a battle Plan to design an application.
* Discover a full app setup.


## Mission objectives

Hello hello hello Everybody!

Today, We are going to start our first own application.

After your presentation, you should be ready to write a few lines of code.

I provided here the template that you all know and love.

But how to work? What steps to take? What to do?

These are existential questions.

We have three main topics.

## Frontend

For the front end section of your application you will have to use your HTML, css and javascript skills and put them to the test.

for these steps, i would create all the visual side of your application before doing anything else.

Then i would prepare all my events in the right place with some reminder of what is left to do.

EG:

```js
const myEventBtn = document.getElementById('btn-primary')

myEventBtn.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  alert('this button should fetch some data from an API and display them on the page.')
})
```
 EG2:

```js
const mySecondEventBtn = document.getElementById('btn-primary')

mySecondEventBtn.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  alert('this button should allow me to save some data to the database')
})
```

Once everything visual related is set up, HTML, CSS and events. And if I use APIS I would tackle the fetching and displaying of these data.

When everything is good to go, you can look to the other chapters.

### Misc

You don't feel like designing stuff. That is okay.
you can use a [professional free template](https://html5up.net/) to start of! If you follow this direction, do not forget to make it your own, change colors, pictures, fonts...

## Database

This chapter can be small or big depending of the scope of your app. If you have more than one table interacting together, I would really reccomend that you first design your db Schema on the appropriate platform [this one for example](https://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/?keyword=default)

if you want some validation before continuing do not hesite to Contact PY or I to check out what you plan to do.

Once this step is done, you can go ahead and run your sqlite3 command on your terminal and use your now favorites SQL queries to create the table of your database.

## Backend

For the backend Part, to avoid being lost on the sea of tasks, I would work on one table at the time.

What happens in my app? when does an entry in a table gets created/Updated/Read/deleted. On work my way on each table step by step.

you could also help you from the memos you wrote yourself when creating the front end to know whats left to do.

EG:

Right, i need to connect this button to a method that allows me to save an entry in the X table of the database...

If you are lost with the syntax, you can use what we wrote for the tasks livecode. It will be a good place to start.



## Features

- Your application should use everything we saw so far: A front end, a backend, a database

- Lets try to also focus on making a nice looking app, as it could be something nice for you to showcase.

- You can use npm libraries, codepen snippets, all the tools in the box.


## TOOLS

do not forget this [extensive list of tools](https://github.com/bradtraversy/design-resources-for-developers) that you can use to help your development.


## Deliverables.

On Friday, You will poresent the work that you already did. We will debrief about it together.

<details>
<summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
After your (Well deserved) Holidays, you will have another 3 days round of development on your app. Followed by a lecture on how to put it online.
</details>

## Last pieace of advice/reminder

The only diference between this challenge and the ones we did last week is that you choose the subject.
The topic we are working on is still interacting with the DB.

Do not forget that you are not alone. People are working on their project, but are still there to lend a hand.

Do not forget, that we are __learning__ ANd this challenge is nothing more than a way for you to learn.
